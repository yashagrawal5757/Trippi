Trippi is a web application that simplifies the process of finding the perfect Airbnb for travelers. 
It allows users to search for Airbnbs in a chosen city, compare current and historic prices, 
explore nearby tourist spots based on the neighborhood of their chosen Airbnb, and select categories such as heritage, food, shopping, and more to discover the different locations. 

Trippi is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Node JS, and uses a MySQL database  (hosted on AWS RDS) to store and manage data. 
This project is developed by **Gokul, Shivani, Yash and Priyanka**.
