Trippi is a web application that simplifies the process of finding the perfect Airbnb for travelers. 
It allows users to search for Airbnbs in a chosen city, compare current and historic prices, explore nearby tourist spots based on the neighborhood of their chosen Airbnb, and select categories such as heritage, food, shopping, and more to discover different locations. Trippi is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and uses a MySQL database to store and manage data. 
This project is developed by Gokul, Shivani, Yash and Priyanka.
